[Roy Bahat](http://about.me/roybahat), President of IGN Networks (a leading online gaming company) dropped by the Dev Bootcamp office. Roy held an informal talk and Q&A with us about his visions about how the world will address the growing need for software engineers. Here were a few of his thoughts and observations from the evening:

*Software engineers are hard to come by. True Story: Roy has personally called perspective entry-level engineers to try to get them to pick IGN over their other offers.


*The education system is teaching engineers the wrong things.Â Software engineering should be less science and more building. Building is fun. Learning rules and constraints are not.


*Roy visualizes a resume-less world where engineers are hired purely based off of their code and fit with the company
