It was a busy week on Dev Bootcamp and honestly we've learned more in one week than I thought would be possible. We have already covered more this week than I remember covering in two 10-week classes that covered C++ and PHP than Shereef assured us today that this was a 
light week and that we can look forward to be even busier next week! Here are a few of the discoveries I have made over the past week:***Learning program language should be viewed like learning a new language.**
 What is the most effective way to learn a language? Immersion. Spending 10-14 hours per day, talking and thinking about code has really helped me to remember syntax, various data types and library methods much more quickly than I would have if I were doing a problem set  and going to class 3 hours per class.

	
***Pair programming is an amazing learning tool! **
Going into the program, this was one of the aspects that I was most nervous about because I was afraid that I'd slow down my partner or be too embarrassed to share my coding style. These concerns are moot after having paired for the majority of the week. There were a couple aspects to pair programming that I think really payed off for me. I found myself focusing for hours at a time without getting distracted. My partner often caught any kind of typo or syntax error that I had made much more quickly than if I was looking for it myself. While working in a pair, we often were able to figure out the problem instead of getting stuck and having to ask for help.

	
***Refactoring code is a lot of fun. **
I never would have thought that it would be so fun to go back and try to come up with new, more concise solutions to previous exercises. I ended up doing one of the exercises, In Words ( describe any integer 1-999 in text), 4 different ways and I was struck by how much more efficiently and cleanly we were able to refine the method each time I went back to it. It turned about to be a really satisfying process. According to Shereef, in the real world, about 
**30%**
 of a developers time is spent refactoring his or her code.

On a side note, check out this video called #leaveyourlegacy that was produced by a 3 Stanford students. Watching it got me pumped up for Dev Bootcamp Week 2!
