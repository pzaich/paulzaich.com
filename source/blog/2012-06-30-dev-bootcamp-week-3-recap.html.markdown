15 days in, 3 weeks down... 7 more weeks to go! Here's a quick summary of what we were able to accomplish and cover in Week 3 of Dev Bootcamp. During the course of the week, at times I feel like I am making incredible strides, at others, I feel like I am  just treading water. Each time I have the chance to reflect on the end of a week of learning, I have honestly been amazed by how much we have covered in the past week.   The projects are getting progressively bigger and more complex and we're taking baby steps forward towards learning how to design and build cleanly with Object-oriented design.

Here are a few of the things I accomplished in Week 3:*Built a 
[Soduku solver app](https://gist.github.com/2992741) that can solve most sudoku puzzles (that do not require guessing) in an Object Oriented design.

	
*Learned the fundamentals of TDD and RSpec and wrote coverage for the ToDo app from last week

	
*Tried to rebuild the todo app using the Rspec coverage. Found out why you never want to try to right tests after the fact. It is hard to write tests that actually cover the app correctly.

	
*Mastered the basics of object 
[constructors](http://www.paulzaich.com/2012/06/27/js/defining-constructor-javascript/) in Javascript.

	
*Built a new Flashcard terminal app from scratch using the TDD process for the first time

	
*Pushed my first mult-file project from Dev Bootcamp to a 
[Github](https://github.com/pzaich/flashcard_app) repo

	
*Had my first code review with Shereef on the Flashcard app. Found out that we could break our current two objects into 4-5 objects for better OO design.
