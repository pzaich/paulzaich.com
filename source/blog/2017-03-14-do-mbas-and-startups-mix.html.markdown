In the Valley, the common assessment amongst peers is that an MBA degree yields diminishing credibility among most startups in Silicon Valley. Furthermore, the large amount of debt incurred in most full-time MBA programs promotes a tendency to optimize for "safer", more stable, high-income industries, not high-risk/high-reward startup plays. Meanwhile, many MBA programs are tuning their pitches towards attracting aspiring entreprenuers as the appeal of the finance and banking industries has diminished since the Great Recession.

While the current trend in startup leadership has been driven in large part by folks with technical backgrounds, it's harder to find definitive data around startup founders with a MBA background. Is the MBA's program's narrative that they serve as a key enabler and a launchpad for entreprenuer's true or is the sceptical view held by many in the Valley more accurate? In order to answer some of these questions, I set out to build a dataset of founders from the top incumbator (Y-Combinator).



## Conclusions
The numbers suggest that MBA participation in startup leadership is not as clear cut as one might expect. After analyzing the backgrounds of 1100+ founders and senior leadership from 934 Y Combinator companies, I found a surprising percentage of CEOs (7%) and founders in general (11.5%) had attended an MBA program prior to founding a company admitted to Y-Combinator. To put those numbers into context, I examined 2 different populations for comparision. First I examined the US Population and secondly I aggregated a list of 479 active executives at Fortune 500 technology companies.

First off let's examine the overall US population. when examining the general US population only 9% of those over 25 has a master's degree[1] and approximately 25% of all master's degrees are in Business Administration[2]. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that 2.25% percent of the US population has obtained an MBA degree. That means that YC CEOs are roughly *3 times more likely to hold an MBA than the average American* and the average YC founder is nearly *6 times more likely*.

Unsurprisingly, Fortune 500 excecutives are more likely to have an MBA in their background than the average CEO.

## Methods
* Scraper + analysis of 1300 profiles.
* Link to google doc


These numbers compare similarly to the Fortune 500

<!-- Need to analyze against some baseline. General population?-->
<!-- Apple / Google? Fortune 500 companies? -->

What value is the MBA bringing? Does it bring true advantage or is the signaling effect of the MBA lend legitimacy that acts as the primary driver of success?
