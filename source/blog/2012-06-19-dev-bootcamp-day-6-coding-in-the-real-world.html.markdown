Today was a bit of a day of transition, but it feels like were are starting to get into the meat and potatoes of using Ruby in real world situations. I started out the day working with 
[Jeremy](http://devbootblog.tumblr.com/), reviewing the material on Procs and Lamdas (different types of blocks that can be passed into methods). Shereef challenged everyone to create an exercise on Socrates that would test a skill in Ruby and we decided to test our knowledge of Procs by building an Inject method from scratch and creating a test around it. Writing Inject was a bit more tricky than creating collect and count methods from scratch as we needed to deal with detecting the data type of the values in the array and needed to be able to handle an argument being passed in. We didn't quite have enough time to finish this exercise before lunch. I'm hoping to get this completed and running tomorrow.

I was itching to get into our first "real" project in the afternoon, but ended up working on a fun recursive exercise created by 
[Jessie](http://jessieay.tumblr.com/) called "Mark Twain"(who was known for his concision) with 
[Brian](http://codesponge.tumblr.com/). Basically we needed to chop off the last word of the inputed string and return the string to an array until the sentence had been shortened to one word. We also built a fun "BaseballTeam" class written by 
[Patrick](http://enterdev.tumblr.com) which consisted of creating methods to add to and list players hashes within a all-star team hash.

After dinner, I had the chance to work with 
[Ken](http://qfthr.tumblr.com/) and we dove head first into JSTwitter, a terminal client for Twitter. Fun to really start seeing how to define methods around an object using the Twitter API.
