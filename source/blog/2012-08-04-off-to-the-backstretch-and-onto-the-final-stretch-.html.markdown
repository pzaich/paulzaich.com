Pardon the horse racing metaphor, I just finished reading 
Seabiscuit.It's been a whirlwind over the past two weeks. From packing my wife up so that she could make her way to South Korea, to our introduction to Rails, I haven't been short of projects to work on. To keep it short and too the point, I'm amazed by the speed at which one can develop in Rails. In the past two weeks I've built in a pair or by myself, a URL shortener (like bit.ly) app, a clone of Hacker News or Reddit, a working 
[polling app](http://pullster.herokuapp.com/) that provides statistics to the owner on user responses, and a basic version of Basecamp with AJAX responses. 

Most of these projects have begun to feel very similar and I'm definitely eager to continue pushing the threshold of my understanding. We begin team projects with a pitch-day on Monday and I'm excited to dive more deeply into a challenging problem for the final two weeks of Dev Bootcamp. I'm not sure at this point if I'm attached to any ideas of my own, but I am attached to the idea of using Rails to generate an API that can be rendered by other frontend frameworks like ember.js or Html5. This seems like the way that many companies will be going in development in the future and I can't wait to work on building up my Javascript chops.
