  <h4>Hi there!</h4>
  <p>
    I'm Paul Zaich. I've been building products for the web since 2010. Lately I've been working on <a href="https://workhands.us">@workhands</a>. You might find me coding in Ruby, Javascript and Swift or on occasion obsessing over pixels in Sketch.

    I live in San Francisco, CA with my lovely wife <a href="http://erinzaich.com">Erin</a> and our son Bennett. You can find me surfing at Ocean Beach in my spare time.
